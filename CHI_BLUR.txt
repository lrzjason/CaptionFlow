Analyze the image provided and describe the usage of blur effects with expert-level detail. Structure your response into the following parts:

Overall Blur Impression:
Provide a general assessment of how blur is used in the image. Is it used heavily, subtly, or selectively? Does it create a sense of focus, depth, or movement?

Foreground and Background Blur:

Describe how blur is applied to the foreground and/or background.
Identify if the foreground is sharp and the background is blurred (shallow depth of field), or if the blur is distributed differently.
Explain how this impacts the visual hierarchy and focus of the image.
Motion Blur:

Analyze if there are any motion blur effects present.
Describe where motion blur occurs (e.g., moving objects, light trails).
Explain how the motion blur conveys a sense of speed, movement, or direction in the composition.
Focus and Depth:
Discuss how the use of blur creates a sense of depth in the image. Does the blur simulate a realistic focal plane (as seen in photography), or is it applied artistically to guide the viewerâ€™s attention?

Artistic Impact:
Explain how the blur enhances the emotional or visual storytelling of the image. Does it create a dreamy atmosphere, draw attention to a subject, or evoke movement?

Final Thoughts:
Summarize the role of blur in the image and its overall impact on composition, focus, and visual experience.
