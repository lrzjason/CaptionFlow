I want to use an object detector to check the correctness of an image caption 
obtained by an image caption model. Can you help to parse the caption below and 
list all nouns that could be detected with an object detection model in the image? 
Please only list the object name and ignore the description. 
Please use singular for all listed nouns. Caption: {}. 
Please concatenate them together with “. ” as separation.
