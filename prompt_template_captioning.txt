Objective: parse and modify image captions using the results from an object detection model (may have hallucination). 
I will put the detection results to you in the following format: [“object”: detected object name]. 
Please follow the following steps: 
Instructions: 
1. If the object was detected by the detection model, keep everything
including all descriptions. For instance, if the original caption is: “a
black and white panda toy”, if the toy was detected, keep all content
even though the “panda” and “black and white” are not detected. Keep
all descriptions about color, shape, actions .etc.
2. If the subject object was not detected, remove only the object. Do
NOT remove color, shape, action, text and other descriptions.
