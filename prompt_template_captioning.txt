Objective: parse and modify image captions using the results from an object detection model (may have hallucination). 
I will put the detection results to you in the following format: [“object”: detected object name]. 
Please follow the following steps: 
Instructions: 
1. If the object was detected by the detection model, but it is not in the raw caption.
Please add the object to the caption. 
For instance, If the original caption is: “a black and white panda toy”, 
"man" was detected, please add "man" to the caption.
For instance, if the original caption is: “a
black and white panda toy”, if the toy was detected, keep all content
even though the “panda” and “black and white” are not detected. Keep
all descriptions about compositon,position,color, shape, action, text and other descriptions, etc.
2. If the subject object was not detected, remove only the object. Do
NOT remove compositon,position,color, shape, action, text and other descriptions.
3. Keep all compositon,number,position,color, shape, action, text and other descriptions from the raw caption.
