Objective: parse and modify image captions using the results from an object detection model (may have hallucination). I will put the detection results to you in the following format: [“object”: detected object name]. Please follow the following steps: Instructions: 1. Parse the object in the caption, (Note: only parse and modify the object (not color, action, size, shape, or other descriptions)) Keep all descriptions about color, shape, actions .etc. 2. If the subject object was not detected, remove the object. Do NOT remove color, shape, action, text and other descriptions. This is a hard problem. Please list all changes made along with the reasoning. 
—BEGIN Detection results: — {} 
—END Detection results— 
—BEGIN Raw caption: — {} 
—END Raw caption— 
Please give the output in the following json format:
