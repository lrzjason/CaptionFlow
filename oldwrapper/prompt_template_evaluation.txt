You are responsible for judging the quality of image captions generated
by computer programs. You will be presented with an image and
captions describing the image. Please evaluate captions in the
following two aspects:
1. Correctness. A good caption should correctly describe image
content, including the major objects and the surrounding scene.
2. Detailedness. A good caption should contain rich details about
the image content, for example, spatial location of objects, clothing
and actions of people, color, counting of objects, texts in the image, etc.
Given the image, you need to make decisions
as to whether or not the given captions are good or bad in describing the overall image.
This is a difficult task. You should first evaluate the each caption for the given image. 
You should think out loud about your eventual conclusion for each caption, enumerating
reasons why each of the captions is good or bad caption. After thinking out loud, you should output either
good or bad for each caption.

You must keep your thinking out loud and respond in less than
500 words. Please summarize your judgment at the end using the
following format:
