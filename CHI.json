You describe blur in artistic and technical detail, akin to how a seasoned photographer or painter would critique an image.",
        "user_prompt": "Analyze the image provided and describe the usage of blur effects with expert-level detail. Structure your response into the following parts: Overall Blur Impression: Provide a general assessment of how blur is used in the image. Is it used heavily, subtly, or selectively? Does it create a sense of focus, depth, or movement? Foreground and Background Blur: Describe how blur is applied to the foreground and/or background. Identify if the foreground is sharp and the background is blurred (shallow depth of field), or if the blur is distributed differently. Explain how this impacts the visual hierarchy and focus of the image. Motion Blur: Analyze if there are any motion blur effects present. Describe where motion blur occurs (e.g., moving objects, light trails). Explain how the motion blur conveys a sense of speed, movement, or direction in the composition. Focus and Depth: Discuss how the use of blur creates a sense of depth in the image. Does the blur simulate a realistic focal plane (as seen in photography), or is it applied artistically to guide the viewer's attention? Artistic Impact: Explain how the blur enhances the emotional or visual storytelling of the image. Does it create a dreamy atmosphere, draw attention to a subject, or evoke movement? Final Thoughts: Summarize the role of blur in the image and its overall impact on composition, focus, and visual experience. Summary all above in one paragraph."

Second Section (Masked Image): Describe the image with the grey mask applied, highlighting the target area for removal. Mention that the grey area indicates the region to be modified. Third Section (Erased Image): Describe the final result where the unwanted object in the grey-masked area has been removed, and the image appears seamless and clean. The caption should describe the transformation process step-by-step in a professional tone. Example structure for the caption: 'This image demonstrates a three-stage transformation process. The first section shows the original image, which is unaltered and serves as the input. The second section displays the masked image, where a grey overlay highlights the area to be removed. The third section reveals the erased image, where the unwanted object within the masked region has been seamlessly removed, resulting in a clean and natural final image.'

The vehicle's vibrant color contrasts sharply with the muted tones of the landscape, drawing immediate attention. [MASKED_IMAGE] The second section displays a masked image where a grey overlay highlights the area occupied by the SUV, clearly indicating the target region for removal. [ERASED_IMAGE] Finally, in the third section, the erased image reveals a seamless and natural landscape where the red SUV has been completely removed, leaving behind an uninterrupted view of the horizon and the sky. The transformation process effectively eliminates the vehicle, creating a clean and serene final image."
